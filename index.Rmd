#  About

## Package Description

This work documents the package `bmrr` introduced in "Multi-object 
Data Integration in the Study of Primary Progressive Aphasia". It also presents 
an usage example in the context of the simulations on the paper for easy
replication. BMRR stands for Bayesian Multi-Object Response Regression and deals 
with a scalar variable of interest as a dependent variable and two objects as 
responses, one a Network object and another an image object or more 
generally a Voxel object. Both objects are linked through regions of interest. 
The main purpose of the model is to determine which regions of interest are 
associated with the variable of interest. The model can incorporate other 
explanatory variables.

## Package Requierments

The package requires the `mvtnorm` package.

## Document Structure

In section \@ref(modelFramework) we introduce the model and variables
